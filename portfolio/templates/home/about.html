    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Nancy, and I’m a passionate coding student with a strong interest in web development and software engineering.</p>
    
    <p>I started learning programming in high school and quickly fell in love with creating websites, building apps, and solving problems with code. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and I plan to dive deeper into backend development soon.</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer and work on projects that make a positive impact. I enjoy learning new technologies, collaborating with others, and turning ideas into real-world applications.</p>
    
    <p>When I’m not coding, I like to read tech blogs, play video games, and contribute to open-source projects.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
